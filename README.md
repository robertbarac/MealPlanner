# MealPlanner
Python project for calculate the optimal amount of food that you have to put on the plate to reach your fitness goals.

Why MealPlanner?
This project was thought for people like me, or in the strictest sense, people like my sister. She attends the gym and practices bodybuilding, 
in the Wellness category. In 2019 she won every competition she was in except for the first one. She became the South American champion that 
year by the IFBB in Ecuador. In 2020 she did not compete due to the pandemic. In 2021 she returned to compete, being the national champion 
and also the Central American and Caribbean champion, winning her professional card. She needs to take her diet with precise and optimal 
measurements for her competition, so far we have not found a mobile application that meets those requirements. MealPlanner seeks to achieve, 
from a certain amount of daily calories, the goal that the user chooses and the number of meals to be consumed in the day, giving the user the 
number of grams to place of each food on the plate to be within your caloric needs.

In this project I made use of my knowledge in python, extern GUI PyQT5 for python, which is based in XML; object-oriented programming, SQLite3 connection 
and commands, creation of modules and packages in python for import into the project, CRUD database operations, etc.

For prove the project, execute the main.py file.
